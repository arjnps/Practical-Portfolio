Movie Management.
This is a simple website that uses HTML,CSS and JavaScrit to show the list of top IMDB rated movies of both 2020 and 2021 along with an image.
It uses a button "2020" to show and hide the list of movies of 2020.
It also features a movie watch list in which you can add the names of movies you want to watch later. After watching, just click on the movie name and the whole text will be strike through. There is also an option for us to remove a movie name from the watch list.
